Explain the apparent contradiction between the factual statements regarding the fit below that \"the model only explains 17.6% of the variability in the data\" while at the same time \"many of the *coefficients* are larger than 10 while having *strong* or *very strong evidence against* the *null hypothesis* of 'no effect'\"<br>\n",

    "> _In `formula='HP ~ Q(\"Sp. Def\") * C(Generation)'` the `Q` stands for \"quote\" and is needed to access column names when they have a \"space\" in their name, while the `C` indicates a **categorical** use of what is actually an **integer** valued column. Despite technically being **continuous** numbers, **integer** often simply indicate categories which should not necessarily be treated as an incremental **continuous predictor variable**. Remember, a model such as $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ means for each unit increase in $x$ the outcome increases \"on average\" by $\\beta_1$; so, if $x$ takes on the values `1` through `6` as the `Generation` **predictor variable** here does, then this means the average value for \"Generation 1\" must be $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ while for \"Generation 2\" it must be $\\beta_0 + 2\\times \\beta_1$ (and so on up to \"Generation 6\" which must be $\\beta_0 + 6\\times \\beta_1$). This might be a very strange restriction to place on something that is really actually a **categorical predictor variable**. You can see in the given model fit below how this six-level **categorical predictor variable** is actually appropriately treated in the specification of the **linear form** using \"Generation 1\" for the \"baseline\" and **binary indicators** to model the \"contrast\" (\"offsets\") for the other \"Generations\"; and, how these are in turn used in the context of the **interaction** considered by the model specification._ \n",

This contractdicts with 'large coefficients have p vals that have strong evidence againts the null' in that large coefficients showing small p values tell us to reject the idea of no change but r^2 of 17.6 tells us that only 17.6% of square error is cpatured when siwtching form the mean to the lienar regression model, how can there be very little change in 'changing from the mean' and there be strong evidence against change change in mean is 0 (or to interpret(very small))"
